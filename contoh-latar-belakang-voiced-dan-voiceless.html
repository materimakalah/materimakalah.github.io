Authorities were called to the scene around 7 a.m. to find 130 wrecked cars strung all along the bridge that connects the Isle of Sheppey to the Kent mainland. "It was very bad." And how upsetting was it?" Extremely. I was so glad to realize that we were okay. Actually, there was a worse accident in front of me. So it became a domino effect, really, cars colliding into each other. And people were badly hurt actually, yeah. Dozens of people were taken to a nearby hospital, and about 200 people were treated by emergency responders at the crash site. No fatalities have been reported. Officials aren't too sure what caused the massive crash, but they suspect the thick fog that covered the crossing early Thursday morning could have something to do with it. "We do know that visibility was very bad, I understand the visibility was down to about 25 meters with thick fog... I've been doing this job for over 20 years. I've never seen anything this size or scale before. Officials have voiced concerns about lighting on the bridge before and have said they will talk to police about whether poor lighting played a role in the crashes.</a>

                                            4. (1) Mickey Mouse, which is short for Mitchell Mouse, is a cartoon character who has become an icon for the Walt Disney Company. It was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney.
The first appearance of Mickey Mouse was in Plane Crazy on May 15, 1928. But the Walt Disney Company celebrates Mickey Mouse birth as November 18, 1928 upon the release of Steamboat Willie, because it is the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon with sound. Mickey Mouse has developed along the years. He first appeared in color in 1935. The first Technicolor Disney film was Flowers and Trees from 1932. (2) He also changed from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.
Mickey's popularity has grown around the world. This was due to his nice nature. Mickey never does anything immoral. (3) However, in 2009 the Walt Disney Company announced that they will begin to rebrand the Mickey Mouse character. (4) The rebranding was done by moving away from his pleasant, cheerful image and reintroducing the imperfect side of his personality, starting with the upcoming Epic Mickey, a Mickey Mouse video game.

                                            The Golden Compass It was always going to be difficult to bring to the screen the Philip Pullman trilogy His Dark Materials because, while the novels are full of characters and images that state-of-the-art CGI could render so effectively, the complex themes present a real challenge for what is essentially an entertainment medium. For those who haven't read the 1,300 pages, it's going to be difficult to appreciate all me going on while, for fans of the novels (such as me) anything left out or changed is going to be something of a let down. it's no wonder then that and 14 years before the first movie hit the screens that American writer-director Chris Weitz at onestage pulled out of the whole enterprise, but its been worth it.While not a total success, this is a fine adaptation of the first novel Northern Lights in the UK and The Golden Compass in the USA- that must surely lead to the filming of the other two novels.The casting is excellent.Thirteen year old acting newcomer from Brighton, the oddly named Dakota there Blue Richards, is convincing as the teenage heroine Lyra Belacqua, even if her urchin' accent wanders somewhat Nicole Kidman is brilliant as the icily in fac smooth Mrs. Coulter.A bearded Daniel Craig is strong as Lord Asriel, Eva Green has the exotic of pr looks for the witches' leader Serafina Pekkala Sam wrap Elliott is suitably gravelly as the cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresby.However, a fantasy film like this would type not work without convincing special effects and, to be generally speaking, these are first class.The various daemons are well-executed and the giant polar bears-especially the heroic lorek Byrnison (voiced you magisterially by lan McKellan) are splendid of h Naturally, all sort of compromises are necessary to thyr bring a work as complex and controversial as this toiodi the big screen but, to my mind, it is acceptable to turn the Magisterium from not simply a representation of the Catholic Church but to a symbol of all religious and political authoritarianism.questions1. which information can be found in the text? a. it took 14 years to finish the movie production.b. the film is based on the philip pullman's life storyc. the special effect used for the film is quite disappointind. northern lights amd the golden compass are similar novelse. he actors and actresses played their characters awfully2. what does he writer think about the film? a. funnyb. boring.c. satisfyingd. so-soe. terrible</a>

Sentences 
The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is having many unfortunate consequences: unexpected deaths, sudden unemployment, strains on healthcare systems around the globe, economic near-collapse, and, much less significantly, odd musings by theologians about the cultural significance of all of this. 
In a series of diary entries in First Things, Rusty Reno, for example, denounces Christian churches for adopting a “secular proposition” that prioritizes earthly life above all else. Christians, he says, have forsworn the graces of sacramental life in favor of “death’s dominion,” leading us to sacrifice “the social” out of our fear of death. 
As a conservative Christian critic of American liberalism, Reno has voiced these sorts of criticisms before, and reading this most recent jeremiad, one cannot help but wonder if perhaps it’s a tad overblown.
In Reno’s read, the fear of death and societal efforts to stop disease and protect the vulnerable are things previous generations knew better than to dwell on. 
Our action—our embrace of inactivity to avoid spreading disease—reveals to him that we believe “physical death is the greatest evil.” 
But plagues are as old as human history and have elicited fear and desperate action long before the advent of an allegedly decadent liberalism. 
Quarantine is not a twenty-first-century invention; societies have often stopped or altered daily activity in efforts to reduce disease transmission. 
To value life enough to fear death is neither novel nor evil. Christians have always recognized the fear of death as a natural emotion arising from love of life, which God created good. 
The Gospel itself promises victory over death. Christ died so that “whether we wake or sleep we might live with him” (1 Thess. 5:10); “the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised” (1 Cor. 15:52); “death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away” (Rev. 21:4). 
Because death is the last evil that Christ conquered, Christians understand fully the widespread aversion to death. 
The proposition that the value of life should be measured in economic terms, that we should be indifferent to the wellbeing of society’s most vulnerable members, strikes us as a “secular proposition.”
Reno’s analysis is more an exercise in cultural commentary than theological discernment. 
He believes social distancing and quarantining will atomize us, that collective social action to stop the spread of a pandemic has the power to destroy the inherent sociability of human nature. 
Yet Christians, together with most intellectual traditions, have always held that sociality is an essential, defining characteristic of the human. 
“Being social” is not something we choose to do, but what we are. Christians believe God created us to be in relationship and that our orientation toward the other reflects the image of God.
If we are truly created as social creatures, then we can be sure that our social natures will not be destroyed by either the virus or counsel from the government or church to quarantine. 
Across the developed world, people ostensibly entitled and coddled by wealth, whom we are told liberal politics has made excessively individualistic, have embraced scarcity and joblessness on behalf of a common global good. 
We ought not discount these simple deeds, but instead recall the words of Albert Schweitzer:
Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action. 
All the rest of this force must be content with small and obscure deeds. </a>

West Cornwall
            The area that was once the engine room of Britain’s mining industry has a haunting beauty. The towns of Redruth and its sibling Camborne were West Cornwall’s mining heartland. It is a place where one must spend time to recognize the beauty. Five kilometers to the west, the village of Portreath overlooks an area of sand, book ended by cliffs.
            Portreath is the best village in the area. It began as the playground of the Redruth Camborne miners. Now it is slightly middle-class resort filled in summer with families on holidays. In the mid 19th century the small harbour bustled with sailing vessels.
            Cornwall’s mining land-scapes have been nominated for World Heritage status. At dusk, we climb Cam Brea, an Iron Age settlement and hill fort close to Redruth. We count more than a dozen mine chimneys against the evening skyline. Standing on top of Cam Brea, it is hard to believe that 150 years ago these relics of the mining industry shrieked with the sound of heavy machinery. Now, except for chirruping of the birds, all is silent.
            If you’ve got the legs and the stamina there’s no better way to get to know Cornwall’s wild Atlantic seaboard than to hike it. The National Trust looks after 260 km of Cornish coastline, sand dunes and sheltered bays for walkers. On a breezy day with the sun flitting in and out of clouds, we take the local bus from Redruth to St Agnes and hike 12 km south to Portreath.
            The 18 km cycling trail is the best in that part of the country. It takes you from Portreath in the west to the river at Devoran in the southeast. The path follows the tracks of the horse drawn tramways that once hauled ore to the ports.
            Surfing is popular on the beaches of west Cornwall. There is always a hardly group of surfers in the waves in all weather. New quay is the surf capital but there are plenty of good beaches north towards Padstow and south to St Ives.

                                            English riddles for you to answer! (Bukan di translate lho ya!)
What has roots as nobody sees,
Is taller than trees,
Up, up it goes,
And yet never grows?
Thirty white horses on a red hill,
First, they champ,
Then they stamp,
Then they standstill.
Voiceless it cries,
Wingless (but) flutters,
Toothless (but) bites,
Mouthless (but) mutters.
An eye in a blue face
Saw an eye in a green face.
"That eye is like to this eye"
Said the first eye,
"But in a low place,
Not in the high place."
It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.
A box without hinges, key, or lid,
Yet golden treasure inside is hidden.
Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.
No-legs lay on one-leg,
two-legs sat near on three-legs,
four-legs got some.
This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.
Now, what are your answers? 
Please answer it correctly, okay?</a>

                            7. 4. (1) Mickey Mouse, which is short for Mitchell Mouse, is a cartoon character who has become an icon for the Walt Disney Company. It was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney.
The first appearance of Mickey Mouse was in Plane Crazy on May 15, 1928. But the Walt Disney Company celebrates Mickey Mouse birth as November 18, 1928 upon the release of Steamboat Willie, because it is the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon with sound. Mickey Mouse has developed along the years. He first appeared in color in 1935. The first Technicolor Disney film was Flowers and Trees from 1932. (2) He also changed from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.
Mickey's popularity has grown around the world. This was due to his nice nature. Mickey never does anything immoral. (3) However, in 2009 the Walt Disney Company announced that they will begin to rebrand the Mickey Mouse character. (4) The rebranding was done by moving away from his pleasant, cheerful image and reintroducing the imperfect side of his personality, starting with the upcoming Epic Mickey, a Mickey Mouse video game.

                            11. Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character who has become an icon for the Walt Disney Company. Mickey Mouse is short for Mitchell Mouse. It was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney.
The first appearance of Mickey Mouse was in Plane Crazy on May 15, 1928. But the Walt Disney Company celebrates Mickey Mouse birth as November 18, 1928 upon the release of Steamboat Willie, because it is the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon with sound. The anthropomorphic mouse has developed along the years. He first appeared in color in 1935. The first Technicolor Disney film was Flowers and Trees from 1932. He also evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.
Mickey's popularity has grown around the world. This was due to his angelic nature.

                            13. The Golden Compass It was always going to be difficult to bring to the screen the Philip Pullman trilogy His Dark Materials because, while the novels are full of characters and images that state-of-the-art CGI could render so effectively, the complex themes present a real challenge for what is essentially an entertainment medium. For those who haven't read the 1,300 pages, it's going to be difficult to appreciate all me going on while, for fans of the novels (such as me) anything left out or changed is going to be something of a let down. it's no wonder then that and 14 years before the first movie hit the screens that American writer-director Chris Weitz at onestage pulled out of the whole enterprise, but its been worth it.While not a total success, this is a fine adaptation of the first novel Northern Lights in the UK and The Golden Compass in the USA- that must surely lead to the filming of the other two novels.The casting is excellent.Thirteen year old acting newcomer from Brighton, the oddly named Dakota there Blue Richards, is convincing as the teenage heroine Lyra Belacqua, even if her urchin' accent wanders somewhat Nicole Kidman is brilliant as the icily in fac smooth Mrs. Coulter.A bearded Daniel Craig is strong as Lord Asriel, Eva Green has the exotic of pr looks for the witches' leader Serafina Pekkala Sam wrap Elliott is suitably gravelly as the cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresby.However, a fantasy film like this would type not work without convincing special effects and, to be generally speaking, these are first class.The various daemons are well-executed and the giant polar bears-especially the heroic lorek Byrnison (voiced you magisterially by lan McKellan) are splendid of h Naturally, all sort of compromises are necessary to thyr bring a work as complex and controversial as this toiodi the big screen but, to my mind, it is acceptable to turn the Magisterium from not simply a representation of the Catholic Church but to a symbol of all religious and political authoritarianism.questions1. which information can be found in the text? a. it took 14 years to finish the movie production.b. the film is based on the philip pullman's life storyc. the special effect used for the film is quite disappointind. northern lights amd the golden compass are similar novelse. he actors and actresses played their characters awfully2. what does he writer think about the film? a. funnyb. boring.c. satisfyingd. so-soe. terrible</h2><br />

The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is having many unfortunate consequences: unexpected deaths, sudden unemployment, strains on healthcare systems around the globe, economic near-collapse, and, much less significantly, odd musings by theologians about the cultural significance of all of this. 
In a series of diary entries in First Things, Rusty Reno, for example, denounces Christian churches for adopting a “secular proposition” that prioritizes earthly life above all else. Christians, he says, have forsworn the graces of sacramental life in favor of “death’s dominion,” leading us to sacrifice “the social” out of our fear of death. 
As a conservative Christian critic of American liberalism, Reno has voiced these sorts of criticisms before, and reading this most recent jeremiad, one cannot help but wonder if perhaps it’s a tad overblown.
In Reno’s read, the fear of death and societal efforts to stop disease and protect the vulnerable are things previous generations knew better than to dwell on. 
Our action—our embrace of inactivity to avoid spreading disease—reveals to him that we believe “physical death is the greatest evil.” 
But plagues are as old as human history and have elicited fear and desperate action long before the advent of an allegedly decadent liberalism. 
Quarantine is not a twenty-first-century invention; societies have often stopped or altered daily activity in efforts to reduce disease transmission. 
To value life enough to fear death is neither novel nor evil. Christians have always recognized the fear of death as a natural emotion arising from love of life, which God created good. 
The Gospel itself promises victory over death. Christ died so that “whether we wake or sleep we might live with him” (1 Thess. 5:10); “the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised” (1 Cor. 15:52); “death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away” (Rev. 21:4). 
Because death is the last evil that Christ conquered, Christians understand fully the widespread aversion to death. 
The proposition that the value of life should be measured in economic terms, that we should be indifferent to the wellbeing of society’s most vulnerable members, strikes us as a “secular proposition.”
Reno’s analysis is more an exercise in cultural commentary than theological discernment. 
He believes social distancing and quarantining will atomize us, that collective social action to stop the spread of a pandemic has the power to destroy the inherent sociability of human nature. 
Yet Christians, together with most intellectual traditions, have always held that sociality is an essential, defining characteristic of the human. 
“Being social” is not something we choose to do, but what we are. Christians believe God created us to be in relationship and that our orientation toward the other reflects the image of God.
If we are truly created as social creatures, then we can be sure that our social natures will not be destroyed by either the virus or counsel from the government or church to quarantine. 
Across the developed world, people ostensibly entitled and coddled by wealth, whom we are told liberal politics has made excessively individualistic, have embraced scarcity and joblessness on behalf of a common global good. 
We ought not discount these simple deeds, but instead recall the words of Albert Schweitzer:
Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action. 
All the rest of this force must be content with small and obscure deeds. </h2><br />

It is a place where one must spend time to recognize the beauty. Five kilometers to the west, the village of Portreath overlooks an area of sand, book ended by cliffs.
            Portreath is the best village in the area. It began as the playground of the Redruth Camborne miners. Now it is slightly middle-class resort filled in summer with families on holidays. In the mid 19th century the small harbour bustled with sailing vessels.
            Cornwall’s mining land-scapes have been nominated for World Heritage status. At dusk, we climb Cam Brea, an Iron Age settlement and hill fort close to Redruth. We count more than a dozen mine chimneys against the evening skyline. Standing on top of Cam Brea, it is hard to believe that 150 years ago these relics of the mining industry shrieked with the sound of heavy machinery. Now, except for chirruping of the birds, all is silent.
            If you’ve got the legs and the stamina there’s no better way to get to know Cornwall’s wild Atlantic seaboard than to hike it. The National Trust looks after 260 km of Cornish coastline, sand dunes and sheltered bays for walkers. On a breezy day with the sun flitting in and out of clouds, we take the local bus from Redruth to St Agnes and hike 12 km south to Portreath.
            The 18 km cycling trail is the best in that part of the country. It takes you from Portreath in the west to the river at Devoran in the southeast. The path follows the tracks of the horse drawn tramways that once hauled ore to the ports.
            Surfing is popular on the beaches of west Cornwall. There is always a hardly group of surfers in the waves in all weather. New quay is the surf capital but there are plenty of good beaches north towards Padstow and south to St Ives.

                            34. English riddles for you to answer! (Bukan di translate lho ya!)
What has roots as nobody sees,
Is taller than trees,
Up, up it goes,
And yet never grows?
Thirty white horses on a red hill,
First, they champ,
Then they stamp,
Then they standstill.
Voiceless it cries,
Wingless (but) flutters,
Toothless (but) bites,
Mouthless (but) mutters.
An eye in a blue face
Saw an eye in a green face.
"That eye is like to this eye"
Said the first eye,
"But in a low place,
Not in the high place."
It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.
A box without hinges, key, or lid,
Yet golden treasure inside is hidden.
Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.
No-legs lay on one-leg,
two-legs sat near on three-legs,
four-legs got some.
This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.
Now, what are your answers? 
Please answer it correctly, okay?</h2><br />
